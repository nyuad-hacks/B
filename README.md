# NYUAD HACKATHON

We got together to code a solution that would help NYU Abu Dhabi students share the cost of transportation and food delivery. We also had some nice presentation slides (attached). The app was written in React Native using Expo. You can easily run the code on snack.expo.io, and, with some adjustments, on Visual Basic Code. Enjoy!
